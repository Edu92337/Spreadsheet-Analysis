# Spreadsheet Analysis and Manipulation with PandasAI

This project uses **Streamlit** and **PandasAI** to enable the interactive analysis and manipulation of CSV spreadsheets in a simple and efficient way, leveraging artificial intelligence to answer user queries about the data.

## Features

- **CSV file upload**: Allows the uploading of CSV files for analysis.
- **Data interaction**: After uploading, the user can interact with the data by querying in natural language.
- **Intelligent responses**: The OpenAI language model is used to answer questions about the data.
- **Custom display**: Query results are displayed in a customized way with tables, charts, and text.
- **Save and download data**: The user can save and download the modified DataFrame in CSV format.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A framework for quickly building interactive web applications.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **PandasAI**: A tool that uses AI models, such as OpenAI, to answer questions about the data.
- **OpenAI**: An API that provides access to language models to generate intelligent responses.
- **pyyaml**: A library to read YAML files, necessary for PandasAI configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
